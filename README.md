## üìú Description
voice2txt is a simple command-line interface (CLI) script designed to transcribe your voice memos into plain text files. Each transcribed file includes a timestamp for easy reference. This tool makes it easier to keep track of your voice notes without the hassle of manual typing.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To use voice2txt, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Application**
   - Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/CollageProject-5to6/voice2txt/releases) to download the latest version of voice2txt.

2. **Install the Required Software**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - If you're unsure if Python is installed, open your command line (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS) and type `python --version`. If it returns a version number, you're good to go.

3. **Setting Up voice2txt**
   - After downloading the application, extract the files to a folder on your computer where you can easily find them.
   - Open your command line tool and navigate to the folder where you extracted the voice2txt files. You can do this by typing `cd path_to_your_folder`, replacing `path_to_your_folder` with the actual path.

4. **Running the Application**
   - To start the transcription, use the command:
     ```bash
     python voice2txt.py path_to_your_voice_memo
     ```
   - Replace `path_to_your_voice_memo` with the actual path of the voice memo file you want to transcribe (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\memo.wav`).

5. **Finding Your Transcripts**
   - After running the command, voice2txt will create a text file in the same folder as your voice memo. The file will be named with a timestamp and have the ".txt" extension.
